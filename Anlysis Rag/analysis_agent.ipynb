      "Answer:\n",
      "According to the context, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) can be calculated by comparing the initial investment in a product or service with its revenue. The formula is not explicitly stated in the text, but based on the context, it appears that CAC is related to the Retention Cost and Contribution Margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "One possible way to calculate CAC would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "CAC = Initial Investment + Retention Costs / (Contribution Margin x Sales)\n",
      "\n",
      "Or more simply:\n",
      "\n",
      "CAC = Initial Investment / (Sales - Contribution Margin)\n",
      "\n",
      "This formula suggests that the Customer Acquisition Cost is calculated by dividing the initial investment in a product or service by its contribution margin, which represents the profit generated per unit sale.\n",

      "The context doesn't explicitly mention \"conversion rate\" in its provided information. However, based on the topics discussed (customer engagement, retention, and loyalty), it can be inferred that a conversion rate might refer to the percentage of customers who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase or engaging with the company.\n",
      "\n",
